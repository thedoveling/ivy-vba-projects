 Development for VBA projects. 

 This is my plan as developed by ChatGPT: 

1. Collaboration Setup

Share your GitHub repository link. 

2. Project Plan
Here’s a structured approach to help you organize your project and achieve your goals with clarity and modularity.

Step 1: Define Project Requirements and Modules
    User Authentication Module:

    A VBA form (UserForm) to prompt for username and password.
    Validate the entered username, but use Environ("UserName") in the connection string for security.
    Database Connection Module:

    Use a standard Oracle database connection string.
    Define error handling in case of invalid credentials or network/database issues.
    Connection retry logic if feasible.
    Query Execution and Data Retrieval Module:

    Handle SQL query executions.
    Use parameters to prevent SQL injection and allow dynamic queries.
    Fetch data and populate Excel sheets dynamically based on user input.
    Data Parsing and Formatting Module:

    Format retrieved data for consistency.
    Implement any necessary data transformations or calculations.
    Logging and Error Handling Module:

    Log each step and capture detailed error information for debugging and accountability.
    Create a separate sheet or log file for error messages.
    User Documentation and Code Maintenance:

    Extensive docstring and inline documentation.
    A README file with instructions on setting up, configuring, and using the tool.
    Consider including a handover document summarizing module functionalities and key logic flows.

Step 2: VBA Code Structure and Guidelines
    Since you aim for low coupling and easy handoff, here’s a suggested structure:

    Module Breakdown: Each major functionality (e.g., Authentication, Database Connection, Logging) should be isolated in its own module.
    Class Modules: Use class modules for objects like DatabaseConnection, User, and Logger. This will help encapsulate functionalities and make each component independently testable.
    Error Handling: Centralize error handling within each module or class to avoid redundancy.
    Parameterization: For flexibility, use parameters where possible (e.g., connection settings, SQL queries) and store these settings in a hidden sheet or config file for easy updates.

Step 3: Outline User Authentication and Connection Logic
    To start, let’s break down the login and connection process with some pseudocode and VBA structure.

    User Authentication Form:

    Create a UserForm for username and password.
    Verify that the username matches Environ("UserName"), and store the password for the connection.
    Database Connection Class (DatabaseConnection.cls):

    Store Oracle connection details (host, port, service name).
    Include a Connect method that accepts username and password, sets up the connection string, and opens the connection.
    Implement error handling within Connect for connection failures or invalid credentials.
    A Disconnect method to cleanly close the connection.
    Logging Class (Logger.cls):

    Capture log messages, including connection attempts, errors, and query executions.
    Optionally, create a log file or sheet for error logging.
