# ivy-vba-projects
 Development for VBA projects. 

Project Plan
Suggested Refactoring Using Pragmatic Programmer Principles
1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each class should focus on a single responsibility:

DatabaseManager: Connection management and query execution.
ConfigManager: Metadata retrieval and configuration management.
DataHandler: Data processing and worksheet population.

2. Clear Lifecycle Flow
Define a clear lifecycle:

Open database connection (DatabaseManager).
Fetch and cache metadata (ConfigManager).
Query data and populate the worksheet (DataHandler).

3. Explicit Dependencies
Pass dependencies explicitly (e.g., pass DatabaseManager to ConfigManager and DataHandler).

4. Avoid Redundant State
Remove duplicate checks for connection state across classes. Rely on a single point of truth (DatabaseManager).


1. User Initiates Process
Trigger: The user provides credentials via the UserForm.
Login Process:
The DatabaseManager validates credentials and establishes a database connection.
2. Data Retrieval Request
Trigger: The user requests data retrieval, specifying the table name and optional configurations (e.g., filters, joins).
Handlers Involved:
ConfigManager: If metadata (column mappings, data types) is needed, it fetches this information using SQLHelper.BuildMetadataQuery.
DatabaseManager: Executes the SQL query via ExecuteQuery.
3. Data Processing
Trigger: A recordset (ADODB.Recordset) is returned from the database.
Handlers Involved:
DataHandler:
Populates headers and rows into the Excel worksheet.
Uses metadata (if applicable) for formatting, validations, and configurations.
4. Excel Worksheet Updates
Trigger: The DataHandler processes the data.
Actions:
Clears existing data but retains headers.
Dynamically populates headers based on metadata or recordset field names.
Writes rows of data into the Excel worksheet.
Formats data into a structured table with optional validation rules and tooltips.
5. Cleanup and Close
Trigger: Data operations are complete.
Handlers Involved:
The DatabaseManager ensures the database connection is closed, cleaning up resources.
Any active transactions are committed or rolled back as needed.
